We have a long history of computer science expertise dating back to the establishment of the Department of Computer Science in 1957, making it one of the oldest computing departments worldwide.

Having a long-established reputation in data management and computational intelligence, we have evolved into a world-leading centre in algorithms, data science, artificial intelligence, and logical methods.

We engage in a broad spectrum of both fundamental and applied research, with research collaborations with many industry partners and academic institutions in the UK and abroad, which complement and inform our taught programmes.

Our undergraduate, postgraduate and research degrees are available part-time and full-time by flexible evening study in central London. Situated in Bloomsbury in the heart of London, students are ideally placed to experience the capitalâ€™s places of education, culture and business. Our taught programmes emphasise the use of information technology in organisations, and aim to empower people with the technical and management skills required to succeed in a competitive market place.
